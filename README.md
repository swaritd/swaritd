- 👋 Hi, I’m Swarit!

- 👀 I'm a 21-year-old developer excited about startups and exponential technologies, currently fascinated by fintech, technology in supply chain/logistics, and autonomous (flight, driving, etc!) systems.

- ⚡️ I currently intern at [Float](www.floatcard.com) and study software engineering at Western University and am a Summer Fellow (SFP1) at [Susa Ventures](www.susaventures.com). 

- 🗓 I previously worked as an investment associate at [Front Row Ventures](www.frontrow.ventures), in data science at TD, and am an alum of [The Knowledge Society](https://tks.world/).
