- 👋 Hi, I’m Swarit!

- 👀 I'm a 21-year-old developer excited about startups and exponential technologies, currently fascinated by fintech, technology in supply chain/logistics, and autonomous (flight, driving, etc!) systems.

- ⚡️ I currently intern at www.floatcard.com and study software engineering at Western University and am a Summer Fellow (SFP1) at www.susaventures.com. I previously worked as an investment associate at Front Row Ventures, in data science at TD, and am an alum of The Knowledge Society.
