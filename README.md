- 👋 Hi, I’m Swarit!

- 👀 I'm a 22-year-old developer excited about startups and exponential technologies, currently fascinated by fintech, technology in supply chain/logistics, and autonomous (flight, driving, etc!) systems.

- ⚡️ I was a SWE intern at [Float](https://www.floatcard.com/) in Summer 2022, and currently am studying software engineering in my 4th year at Western University. I'm also a Summer Fellow (SFP1) at [Susa Ventures](https://www.susaventures.com/). 

- 🗓 I also previously worked as an investment associate at [Front Row Ventures](https://www.frontrow.ventures/), in data science at TD, and am an alum of [The Knowledge Society](https://tks.world/).
